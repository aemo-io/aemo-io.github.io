# Hello ðŸ‘‹ we're aemo.

## The mortgage industry in the UK isn't good enough.

### And that's why we're here.


We have to jump through so many hoops to get on to the property ladder, and once we're there, it's so difficult to know that we're getting a good deal. Combine that with confusing terminology and legal jargon, then it's clear we're dealing with an industry that could do with a shake up.

So, we're going to change things. 

Mortgage companies aren't incentivised to tell you if you're overpaying, so we're starting by helping the millions of UK homeowners who are overpaying by thousands of pounds every year on standard variable mortgage rates.

We're using Open Banking and other new technologies to make finding a great deal and applying for your remortgage super simple - and then we'll be here to support you every step of the way.

Want to keep up to date with our progress? Drop us an email at [hello@aemo.io](mailto: hello@aemo.io), we'd love to hear from you and to learn from your experiences! ðŸ“§

## About us

Luke is a Senior Engineering Manager at [Monzo](https://monzo.com/), where he leads the teams who build and operate Monzo's Infrastructure Platform. Before Monzo, he helped scale technology teams at [OVO](https://ovo.com/) and has worked with technology teams across the public sector and in private retail.

Luke started aemo after he went through a couple of bad experiences with remortgages - receiving bad service, overpaying on variable rates, and having to submit stacks of paper documents whilst going back and forth to the post office.
