We'd love to speak to people who are open to sharing their experience of taking out a mortgage in the UK - whether that's as a first time buyer, or someone who is remortgaging. Email us at [hello@aemo.io](mailto: hello@aemo.io) or send us a message on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/aemo_io) if you'd like to learn more about what we're up to!


### Technical co-founders üßë‚Äçüíª
We're also looking for a technical co-founder to help us move faster on our way to launch.

If you're a software engineer who's interested in changing the way the mortgage industry in the UK works, reach out at [hello@aemo.io](mailto: hello@aemo.io).
